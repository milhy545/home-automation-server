# FEI Network: Distributed GPU Compute & Model Ecosystem

## Overview: The Democratized AI Network

The FEI Network represents a paradigm shift in distributed AI systems - a fully decentralized ecosystem where individual nodes contribute GPU computing capacity to train, finetune, and serve specialized AI models. By leveraging blockchain-inspired coordination mechanisms, the network efficiently allocates tasks, rewards contributions, and creates a democratized AI infrastructure accessible to all.

Unlike centralized AI services dominated by major providers, the FEI Network operates as a cooperative mesh of consumer and professional hardware, dynamically scaling to accommodate diverse computational needs while rewarding participants with FeiCoin.

## Core Principles

### 1. Resource Democratization
Any GPU-equipped device can participate, from gaming PCs to professional workstations, contributing according to their capacity while being fairly compensated.

### 2. Specialized Model Development
The network prioritizes small, purpose-specific models over large generalists, enabling fine-tuned expertise for particular domains, languages, or tasks.

### 3. Distributed Training & Storage
Training data and model weights are distributed across the network, with the Memorychain providing storage, provenance, and retrieval mechanisms.

### 4. Task-Based Allocation
The network dynamically matches training and inference tasks to appropriate nodes based on hardware capability, availability, and specialization.

### 5. Contribution-Based Rewards
Nodes earn FeiCoin proportional to their computational contributions, creating an incentive economy that reflects true value generation.

### 6. Progressive Improvement
Models continuously evolve through collaborative improvement, with successful adaptations propagating throughout the network based on performance metrics.

            self._meets_hardware_requirements(status, task_specification) and
            self._meets_capability_requirements(status, task_specification)):
            
            # Calculate suitability score
            score = self._calculate_node_suitability(status, task_specification)
            eligible_nodes.append((node_id, status, score))
    
    # Sort by suitability score
    eligible_nodes.sort(key=lambda x: x[2], reverse=True)
    
    # Create allocation plan
    if task_specification.get("distributed", False):
        # For distributed training, select multiple nodes
        return self._create_distributed_allocation(eligible_nodes, task_specification)
    else:
