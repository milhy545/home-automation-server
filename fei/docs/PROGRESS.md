# FEI Progress Report

## Implementation of Status Reporting

We have successfully implemented status reporting for FEI nodes in the Memorychain system. This implementation allows FEI instances to report their current AI model, operational status, and task information to the network.

### Features Implemented

1. **AI Model Reporting**
   - FEI nodes now report which AI model they are using (e.g., "claude-3-opus", "gpt-4")
   - Model information is updated whenever the model changes
   - Other nodes can see which models are being used across the network

2. **Status States**
   - Implemented status states: idle, busy, working_on_task, solution_proposed, task_completed
   - Status automatically updates during conversation and task processing
   - Status includes timestamp of last update

3. **Task Progress Tracking**
   - FEI nodes report which task they are currently working on
   - Task IDs are tracked and visible to other nodes
   - Load information (from 0.0 to 1.0) indicates resource utilization

4. **Network-wide Status Overview**
   - Added ability to query the status of all nodes in the network
   - Network load is calculated as an average of all node loads
   - Status information is available via API and CLI interface

5. **CLI Commands**
   - Added `/status` command to view network status
   - Added `/model <name>` command to change AI model

### Implementation Details

1. **Enhanced MemorychainConnector**
   - Added `update_status()` method to report node status
   - Added `get_node_status()` method to query local node status
   - Added `get_network_status()` method to query all nodes' status

2. **Updated FEI Integration**
   - FEI now reports its status as "busy" during conversations
   - Returns to "idle" when not processing requests
   - Reports its AI model information automatically

3. **Example Applications**
   - Created `fei_status_reporting_example.py` to demonstrate status reporting
   - Updated `fei_memorychain_example.py` to include status reporting

### Usage

To use the status reporting functionality, you can:

1. Use the MemorychainConnector methods directly:
   ```python
   # Update status
   connector.update_status(status="busy", ai_model="claude-3-opus", load=0.7)
   
   # Get network status
   network_status = connector.get_network_status()
   ```

2. Use the enhanced FEI examples:
   ```bash
   # Run the status reporting example
   python examples/fei_status_reporting_example.py
   
   # Use status commands in the Memorychain example
   python examples/fei_memorychain_example.py
   # Then type "/status" to see network status
   ```

### Next Steps

1. **Authentication for Status Updates**
   - Add authentication to ensure only authorized nodes can update status

2. **Status History**
   - Implement tracking of status changes over time
   - Add analytics for node activity patterns

3. **Load Balancing**
   - Develop automatic task distribution based on node status
   - Implement intelligent routing of tasks based on AI model capabilities

4. **Status Visualization**
   - Create a web dashboard for visualizing network status
   - Add graphical representations of node activity
