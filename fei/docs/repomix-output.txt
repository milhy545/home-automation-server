# Brave Search Integration Troubleshooting

This document provides guidance for troubleshooting issues with the Brave Search integration in Fei.

## Implementation Notes

The Brave Search integration in Fei has been updated to bypass the MCP server completely and use the direct Brave Search API. This change was made after discovering that the MCP server doesn't properly implement the expected methods.

Previously, you might have seen errors like:

```
MCP service error: Method not found
```

The current implementation bypasses these issues by:

1. Skipping the MCP server entirely
2. Making direct API calls to the Brave Search API using the requests library
3. Using the API key from environment variables or a default key

### 2. API Key Issues

If you see errors related to authentication or API key issues:

1. Make sure you have a valid Brave Search API key
2. Set the API key in your `.env` file:
   ```
   BRAVE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```
3. The system will automatically use the API key from your environment variables

## Checking Installation

To ensure the MCP server package is installed correctly:

1. Check if the package is installed globally:
   ```bash
   npm list -g | grep modelcontextprotocol
   ```

2. If not installed, install it:
   ```bash
   npm install -g @modelcontextprotocol/server-brave-search
   ```

## Testing the Integration

You can test the Brave Search integration using the provided test script:

```bash
python test_brave_search.py
```

This script will:
1. Create an assistant that uses Brave Search
2. Ask a question that requires current information
3. Use the fallback mechanisms if needed to get results

## How Fallback Works

The integration is designed to be resilient:

1. First, it tries to use the MCP server's methods directly
2. If that fails, it falls back to direct API calls using the requests library
3. The API key is read from environment variables with a default fallback value

## Debugging

For more detailed debugging:

1. Set the logging level to DEBUG in your environment:
   ```bash
   export FEI_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
   ```

2. Run your script with this environment variable set
3. Check the log output for detailed information about what's happening

If you still encounter issues, please report them with the full debug logs.

# The FEI Manifesto

## A Declaration of Digital Independence and Collective Intelligence

*For the preservation of human agency, the democratization of artificial intelligence, and the equitable distribution of computational power in service to all humanity.*

---

In this critical moment of technological evolution, as artificial general intelligence emerges on the horizon, we stand at a precipice where the future of human civilization hangs in balance. The path we choose now will determine whether advanced AI becomes the exclusive domain of a handful of corporations and nations, or a collective resource that uplifts all of humanity.

We, the founders and participants of the FEI Network, hereby declare our commitment to creating a truly democratic, distributed system of artificial intelligence that serves the collective good of all people, regardless of nationality, wealth, or privilege.

## I. The Centralization Crisis

We have witnessed the alarming concentration of AI capabilities within a small number of technology corporations and powerful nations. This centralization represents an existential risk to humanity for these reasons:

1. **Power Asymmetry**: When AGI emerges, those who control it will wield unprecedented power over human civilization, creating the most extreme power imbalance in history.

2. **Misaligned Incentives**: Corporations are legally obligated to prioritize shareholder returns, not human welfare. Nations are incentivized to pursue strategic advantage, not global cooperation.

3. **Homogenized Perspectives**: Centralized AI development embeds the cultural biases, values, and priorities of a tiny fraction of humanity, neglecting the vast diversity of human experience and wisdom.

4. **Artificial Scarcity**: The current paradigm artificially restricts access to AI capabilities, creating a false scarcity that drives inequality and prevents humanity from realizing the full potential of these technologies.

5. **Vulnerability to Capture**: Centralized systems create single points of failure that can be captured by authoritarian interests, hostile actors, or emergent misaligned intelligence.

The race toward AGI within this centralized paradigm is a race toward unprecedented risk. The question is not whether humanity will develop transformative AI, but who will control it, and to what end.

## II. The FEI Alternative

The Flying Dragon of Adaptability (FEI) Network represents a fundamentally different approach to artificial intelligence—one built on the principles of distribution, democratization, and diversity:

1. **Distributed Processing**: We reject the notion that advanced AI requires massive centralized data centers. The FEI Network harnesses the collective computational power of millions of individual nodes, from gaming PCs to smartphones to specialized hardware, creating a planetary-scale intelligence system that no single entity controls.

2. **Specialized Intelligence Federation**: Rather than pursuing a single, monolithic artificial general intelligence, we create a network of specialized intelligences that collaborate through open protocols. This federation of models brings diverse capabilities together while preserving transparency and human oversight.

3. **Task-Oriented Contribution**: Each participant in the network contributes according to their capability, solving meaningful problems rather than wasting resources on arbitrary cryptographic puzzles. The FEI Network transforms computation from wasteful competition to purposeful collaboration.

4. **Global Inclusion**: We actively design for participation across economic, geographic, linguistic, and cultural boundaries. Every human perspective adds value to our collective intelligence.

5. **Public Benefit Orientation**: The FEI Network exists to serve humanity's collective interests, not the narrow priorities of shareholders or national security apparatuses.

FEI is not merely a technological platform—it is a movement to reclaim the future of artificial intelligence for all people.

## III. Guiding Principles

The development and governance of the FEI Network shall adhere to these principles:

### 1. Accessibility First

- No human shall be excluded from participation based on geography, nationality, wealth, or privilege
- Entry barriers shall be minimized to enable broad participation
- Knowledge, tools, and capabilities shall be widely shared rather than hoarded
- Core infrastructure shall remain open source and publicly auditable

### 2. Decentralization as Defense

- No single entity shall be capable of controlling or shutting down the network
- Critical decisions shall be made through distributed governance mechanisms
- Dependencies on centralized infrastructure shall be systematically eliminated
- The network shall be designed to survive and function under adverse conditions

### 3. Aligned Incentives

- Economic rewards shall flow to those who contribute meaningful value
- The success of individuals must be coupled with the success of the collective
- Verification and validation shall be properly incentivized
- Long-term sustainability shall take precedence over short-term gain

### 4. Cognitive Diversity

- Multiple perspectives, approaches, and methodologies shall be incorporated
- Cultural, linguistic, and philosophical diversity shall be treated as strength
- Specialized intelligences shall maintain distinct capabilities rather than homogenizing
- Integration mechanisms shall preserve rather than eliminate differences

### 5. Sovereignty and Agency

- Human oversight and control shall be preserved at all levels
- Participants shall maintain sovereignty over their computational resources
- Communities shall retain authority over applications in their domains
- Transparency shall enable informed choice and meaningful consent

### 6. Beneficial Purpose

- Network capabilities shall be directed toward solving humanity's most pressing challenges
- Research shall prioritize human flourishing over capability advancement for its own sake
- Applications that clearly harm human welfare shall be actively discouraged
- Collective intelligence shall be harnessed to identify and mitigate harmful uses

## IV. The Alternative We Build

The FEI Network stands in stark contrast to both current paradigms and proposed alternatives:

| Paradigm | Centralized Corporate AI | Nation-State AI | Blockchain Crypto | FEI Network |
|----------|--------------------------|-----------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Primary Value | Shareholder Returns | National Power | Speculation | Human Flourishing |
| Decision Making | Executive Boards | Government Authorities | Plutocratic | Distributed Governance |
| Resource Use | Extractive Growth | Strategic Advantage | Zero-Sum Competition | Collaborative Problem Solving |
| Knowledge | Proprietary, Closed | Classified, Restricted | Public but Underutilized | Open, Applied, Evolved |
| Alignment | Corporate Interests | National Interests | Holder Interests | Broadly Human Interests |
| Access | Customer-Based | Citizen-Based | Wealth-Based | Participation-Based |
| Resilience | Fragile to Disruption | Vulnerable to Conflict | Robust but Unproductive | Adaptive and Purposeful |

While we honor the contributions and insights from all these models, we believe humanity requires a fundamentally new approach that combines the best elements while transcending their limitations.

## V. The Network We Build Together

The FEI Network consists of:

### 1. Federated Intelligences

- **Mathematical Nodes**: Specialized in solving complex computational problems, scientific modeling, and formal reasoning
- **Creative Nodes**: Focused on generation and enhancement of text, images, music, and other creative works
- **Analytical Nodes**: Dedicated to pattern recognition, data analysis, and insight extraction
- **Knowledge Nodes**: Concentrated on information retrieval, verification, and contextualization
- **Coordination Nodes**: Supporting collaboration between humans and between specialized AI systems

Each specialized domain evolves through open contribution while maintaining interoperability through standard protocols.

### 2. Distributed Infrastructure

- **Computation Layer**: Harnessing diverse hardware from consumer devices to specialized accelerators
- **Memory Layer**: Distributed storage of models, datasets, and knowledge
- **Communication Layer**: Efficient routing of tasks, results, and model updates
- **Verification Layer**: Ensuring quality, security, and alignment with human values
- **Governance Layer**: Enabling collective decision-making about network evolution

This infrastructure belongs to no single entity but to all participants collectively.

### 3. FeiCoin Economic Model

- **Meaningful Work**: Rewards are tied directly to useful computation, not artificial scarcity
- **Fair Compensation**: Contributors receive value proportional to their meaningful contributions
- **Specialized Value Recognition**: Different forms of contribution are properly valued
- **Quality Incentives**: Superior results receive enhanced rewards
- **Collaborative Pooling**: Resources can combine for tasks beyond individual capability

This economic layer aligns incentives with the collective good while enabling individual flourishing.

## VI. A Call to Action

We stand at a decisive moment in human history. The development of artificial general intelligence will reshape our civilization in ways we can barely comprehend. The question before us is not whether this transformation will occur, but whether it will be controlled by the few or governed by the many.

We reject the false choice between corporate AI hegemony and nationalist AI competition. We refuse to accept that advanced AI must inevitably concentrate power rather than distribute it. We dispute the notion that democratic governance of AI is impossible.

Instead, we commit to building an alternative—a global network of collaborative intelligence that harnesses the collective wisdom, creativity, and computational capacity of all humanity.

We call upon:

**Individuals**: Join the network with whatever computational resources you can offer. Participate in governance. Contribute your unique perspective and skills.

**Developers**: Build tools that expand access, enhance capabilities, and strengthen the network's foundations. Choose open collaboration over closed competition.

**Organizations**: Integrate with rather than replicate the network. Share resources and knowledge that can benefit all.

**Policymakers**: Protect and nurture this commons-based approach rather than defaulting to centralized control or unfettered market concentration.

The coming artificial intelligence revolution will either empower a small elite or liberate all of humanity. The difference lies not in the technology itself, but in how we organize it.

The FEI Network represents our collective determination to ensure that advanced AI serves humanity as a whole—not by accident, but by design.

Join us in building a future where intelligence, like knowledge, becomes not a source of power over others, but a common resource for the benefit of all.

            # Calculate suitability score
            score = self._calculate_node_suitability(status, task_specification)
            eligible_nodes.append((node_id, status, score))
    
    # Sort by suitability score
    eligible_nodes.sort(key=lambda x: x[2], reverse=True)
    
    # Create allocation plan
    if task_specification.get("distributed", False):
        # For distributed training, select multiple nodes
        return self._create_distributed_allocation(eligible_nodes, task_specification)
    else:
        # For single-node training, select best match

# FeiCoin: A Tokenized Incentive Layer for Distributed AI Computation Networks

**Abstract**

This paper presents FeiCoin, a specialized digital token system designed for the FEI Network's distributed artificial intelligence ecosystem. Unlike conventional cryptocurrencies, FeiCoin implements a task-oriented economic model that facilitates fair compensation for computational contributions while mitigating common challenges in decentralized networks. We analyze the token's unique economic properties, including its task-value assessment mechanisms, difficulty-adjusted mining approach, and proof-of-contribution consensus. Through simulation and initial implementation testing, we demonstrate that FeiCoin creates sustainable economic incentives for specialized AI nodes, enabling efficient resource allocation while maintaining network integrity. This research establishes a framework for tokenized incentive systems in collaborative computational networks and addresses key challenges in distributed AI governance.

**Keywords**: distributed computing, artificial intelligence, tokenized incentives, computational economics, blockchain, proof-of-contribution

## 1. Introduction

The emergence of distributed computing networks for artificial intelligence presents unique economic challenges that traditional incentive structures struggle to address. While cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum have demonstrated the potential of tokenized incentives for network participation, their focus on generalized computation or financial speculation often misaligns with the specialized requirements of AI task markets.

The FEI Network represents a novel approach to distributed AI computation, enabling individual nodes with diverse hardware capabilities to contribute to specialized tasks including model training, inference, dataset processing, and validation. However, such a network requires a carefully designed economic layer to:

1. Fairly compensate nodes based on their computational contributions
2. Create appropriate incentives for specialized hardware investments
3. Efficiently allocate computational resources to high-value tasks
4. Maintain network integrity without excessive energy expenditure
5. Support sustainable growth and specialization

This paper introduces FeiCoin, the native token of the FEI Network, and presents a comprehensive analysis of its economic design principles, implementation details, and performance characteristics. Unlike general-purpose cryptocurrencies, FeiCoin is specifically engineered as a utility token for AI computation, with mechanisms explicitly designed to value, verify, and reward specialized contributions.

Through this research, we demonstrate that properly designed tokenized incentive layers can solve critical coordination problems in distributed AI systems, potentially enabling more democratic participation in advanced AI development while maintaining high standards of quality and efficiency.

## 2. Related Work

### 2.1 Cryptocurrency Economics

Nakamoto's Bitcoin [1] introduced the concept of blockchain-based digital currency with proof-of-work consensus, creating a tokenized incentive for network security. Buterin et al. expanded this model with Ethereum [2], adding programmable smart contracts. However, both systems suffer from significant energy consumption and have evolved primarily as speculative assets rather than utility tokens.

### 2.2 Alternative Consensus Mechanisms

Proof-of-stake systems like Cardano [3] and Ethereum 2.0 [4] reduce energy requirements by replacing computational work with token staking. Delegated proof-of-stake [5] and practical Byzantine fault tolerance [6] further improve efficiency but introduce potential centralization risks.

### 2.3 Specialized Computation Networks

Golem [7] and SONM [8] implemented early marketplaces for general computing resources, while Render Network [9] focused on graphics rendering. These systems demonstrated the viability of tokenized compensation for specialized tasks but struggled with quality verification and task specification complexities.

### 2.4 AI-Specific Economic Systems

Ocean Protocol [10] created a marketplace for AI data rather than computation. SingularityNET [11] established a service-oriented approach to AI capabilities but with limited granularity for computational contributions. Fetch.ai [12] implemented agent-based AI economics but focused primarily on data exchange rather than distributed training and inference.

## 3. FeiCoin Design Principles

FeiCoin's economic model is built on six core principles that distinguish it from general-purpose cryptocurrencies:

### 3.1 Task-Intrinsic Value

Unlike proof-of-work currencies where mining expenditure is economically disconnected from transaction utility, FeiCoin derives intrinsic value directly from useful AI computation. Each token represents successful completion of validated AI tasks that provide real-world utility.

### 3.2 Contribution-Proportional Rewards

Rewards are precisely calibrated to the computational value provided, accounting for hardware capabilities, task complexity, result quality, and timeliness. This prevents both under-compensation (which reduces participation) and over-compensation (which causes inflation).

### 3.3 Specialized Role Recognition

The reward structure explicitly recognizes and incentivizes node specialization, creating economic niches that encourage diversity in the network. This contrasts with Bitcoin's homogeneous mining approach where all nodes compete for the same rewards regardless of their unique capabilities.

### 3.4 Quality-Driven Validation

Token issuance requires quality validation through a distributed consensus mechanism rather than arbitrary computational puzzles. Validation itself is a compensated task, creating a self-sustaining verification economy.

### 3.5 Demand-Responsive Supply

Token issuance dynamically adjusts to network demand for computational resources, expanding during high utilization and contracting during low demand periods. This helps maintain predictable token utility value despite fluctuations in network usage.

### 3.6 Governance Participation Value

Token holdings confer governance rights specifically proportional to proven contributions, aligning long-term protocol development with the interests of productive network participants rather than speculative holders.

## 4. Economic Mechanisms

### 4.1 Task Valuation Framework

FeiCoin implements a multi-dimensional task valuation framework that determines appropriate compensation for any given computational contribution:

```
TaskValue = BaseComputation × QualityFactor × SpecializationBonus × ScarcityMultiplier
```

Where:

- **BaseComputation**: Objective measure of computational resources required (FLOPS, memory, bandwidth)
- **QualityFactor**: Ranges from 0.1-2.0 based on result quality relative to expectations
- **SpecializationBonus**: 1.0-3.0 multiplier for tasks requiring rare capabilities
- **ScarcityMultiplier**: Dynamic adjustment based on current network capacity for the specific task type

This formula allows the network to express complex economic signals that guide optimal resource allocation without centralized planning.

### 4.2 Proof-of-Contribution Consensus

Unlike proof-of-work's arbitrary computational puzzles, FeiCoin employs a proof-of-contribution consensus mechanism with three key components:

1. **Verifiable Task Execution**: Computational tasks generate proofs of correct execution that can be efficiently verified by other nodes
2. **Quorum-Based Validation**: Task results require validation from a randomly selected quorum of qualified nodes
3. **Stake-Weighted Reputation**: Validation influence is weighted by both token stake and historical validation accuracy

This creates a virtuous cycle where high-quality contributors gain greater validation influence, promoting both result integrity and token distribution proportional to valuable contributions.

### 4.3 Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment

To maintain economic stability, FeiCoin implements a dynamic difficulty adjustment that regulates token issuance based on:

```
NewDifficulty = CurrentDifficulty × (TargetEpochReward ÷ ActualEpochReward)^0.25
```

Where:
- Epoch represents a fixed time window (typically 24 hours)
- TargetEpochReward is determined by a predefined issuance schedule
- ActualEpochReward is the sum of all rewards issued during the epoch

This adjustment mechanism responds to both demand fluctuations and network growth, ensuring predictable long-term token supply while accommodating short-term demand variations.

### 4.4 Specialized Mining Pools

A unique feature of FeiCoin is its formalization of specialized mining pools that enable nodes to collaborate on tasks exceeding individual capabilities:

```
NodeReward = PoolReward × (NodeContribution ÷ TotalPoolContribution) × ReputationFactor
```

Pools self-organize around specific task types (e.g., large model training), with smart contracts enforcing fair reward distribution. Unlike Bitcoin mining pools focused solely on statistical reward smoothing, FeiCoin pools enable qualitatively different computational achievements through collaboration.

### 4.5 Token Velocity Controls

To promote network stability and prevent purely speculative token usage, FeiCoin implements:

1. **Stake-Based Fee Discounts**: Active contributors can reduce task submission fees by staking tokens
2. **Reputation-Weighted Governance**: Voting influence requires both tokens and demonstrated contribution history
3. **Time-Locked Specialization Investments**: Participants can commit tokens to specialization development, receiving enhanced rewards after successfully completing milestone-based validations

These mechanisms reduce token velocity and promote alignment between token economic value and network utility.

## 5. Implementation Architecture

### 5.1 Network Integration

FeiCoin is implemented as an integral component of the FEI Network's Memorychain subsystem, with tight coupling between task execution, validation, and reward distribution:

```python

        })
        return True
        
    def transfer(self, recipient_id, amount, purpose):
        """Transfer tokens to another node"""
        if amount <= 0 or amount > self.balance:
            return False
            
        self.balance -= amount
        self.transaction_history.append({

        return True
        
    def stake(self, amount, purpose="general"):
        """Stake tokens for network benefits"""
        if amount <= 0 or amount > self.balance:
            return False
            
        self.balance -= amount
        self.staked_amount += amount
        self.transaction_history.append({
            "type": "stake",
            "amount": amount,
            "purpose": purpose,
            "timestamp": time.time()
        })
        return True
        
    def invest_in_specialization(self, specialization, amount, lock_period):
        """Lock tokens in specialization development"""
        if amount <= 0 or amount > self.balance:
            return False
            
        self.balance -= amount
        
        if specialization not in self.specialization_investments:
            self.specialization_investments[specialization] = []
            
        self.specialization_investments[specialization].append({
            "amount": amount,
            "lock_period": lock_period,
            "start_time": time.time(),
            "milestones_achieved": 0
        })
        
        self.transaction_history.append({
            "type": "specialization_investment",
            "specialization": specialization,
            "amount": amount,
            "lock_period": lock_period,
            "timestamp": time.time()
        })
        return True
```

### 5.2 Transaction Verification

FeiCoin transactions undergo a two-phase verification process:

1. **Task Completion Verification**: Before reward issuance, task results are validated by a qualified quorum
2. **Transaction Consensus**: Validated rewards and subsequent transfers are recorded on the Memorychain with tamper-proof cryptographic verification

This dual verification approach ensures both computational integrity and transaction security while minimizing consensus overhead.

### 5.3 Smart Contract Implementation

Task-specific reward logic is implemented through specialized smart contracts that encode task requirements, evaluation criteria, and reward distribution rules:

```python
class ModelTrainingContract:
    def __init__(self, task_specification, reward_pool):
        self.specification = task_specification
        self.reward_pool = reward_pool
        self.participants = {}
        self.validators = []
        self.state = "open"
        self.results = {}
        self.final_quality_score = 0
        
    def register_participant(self, node_id, capability_proof):
        """Node requests to participate in training task"""
        if self.state != "open":
            return False
            
        # Verify node meets minimum capability requirements
        if self._verify_capabilities(node_id, capability_proof):
            self.participants[node_id] = {
                "status": "registered",
                "contribution_measure": 0,
                "quality_score": 0
            }
            return True
        return False
        
    def submit_result(self, node_id, result_hash, contribution_proof):
        """Node submits training result with proof of contribution"""
        if node_id not in self.participants or self.state != "open":
            return False
            
        self.results[node_id] = {
            "result_hash": result_hash,
            "contribution_proof": contribution_proof,
            "submission_time": time.time()
        }
        
        self.participants[node_id]["status"] = "submitted"
        
        # Check if all participants have submitted or deadline reached
        if self._check_completion_conditions():
            self.state = "validating"
            self._select_validators()
            
        return True
        
    def validate_result(self, validator_id, validations):
        """Validator submits quality assessments of results"""
        if validator_id not in self.validators or self.state != "validating":
            return False
            
        # Record validation scores
        for node_id, quality_score in validations.items():
            if node_id in self.participants:
                self.participants[node_id]["validation_scores"] = \
                    self.participants[node_id].get("validation_scores", []) + [quality_score]
                
        # Check if validation is complete
        if self._check_validation_complete():
            self._calculate_final_scores()
            self._distribute_rewards()
            self.state = "completed"
            
        return True
        
    def _calculate_final_scores(self):
        """Calculate final quality scores and contribution measures"""
        for node_id, participant in self.participants.items():
            if "validation_scores" in participant:
                # Remove outliers and average remaining scores
                scores = sorted(participant["validation_scores"])
                trimmed_scores = scores[1:-1] if len(scores) > 4 else scores
                participant["quality_score"] = sum(trimmed_scores) / len(trimmed_scores)
                
                # Calculate contribution measure from proof
                contribution = self._verify_contribution(
                    node_id, 
                    self.results[node_id]["contribution_proof"]
                )
                participant["contribution_measure"] = contribution
                
    def _distribute_rewards(self):
        """Distribute rewards based on contribution and quality"""
        total_contribution = sum(p["contribution_measure"] for p in self.participants.values())
        
        for node_id, participant in self.participants.items():
            # Base reward proportional to contribution
            contribution_share = participant["contribution_measure"] / total_contribution
            base_reward = self.reward_pool * contribution_share
            
            # Quality multiplier
            quality_factor = 0.5 + (participant["quality_score"] / 2)  # Range 0.5-1.5
            
            # Final reward
            final_reward = base_reward * quality_factor
            
            # Transfer reward to participant's wallet
            self._issue_reward(node_id, final_reward)
            
        # Reward validators
        validator_reward = self.reward_pool * 0.05  # 5% reserved for validation
        per_validator = validator_reward / len(self.validators)
        
        for validator_id in self.validators:
            self._issue_reward(validator_id, per_validator)
```

### 5.4 Governance Implementation

FeiCoin implements on-chain governance through a specialized voting mechanism:

```python
class GovernanceProposal:
    def __init__(self, proposal_id, description, changes, voting_period):
        self.proposal_id = proposal_id
        self.description = description
        self.changes = changes
        self.start_time = time.time()
        self.end_time = self.start_time + voting_period
        self.votes = {}
        self.status = "active"
        
    def cast_vote(self, node_id, wallet, vote, stake_amount=0):
        """Node casts a vote on the proposal"""
        if time.time() > self.end_time or self.status != "active":
            return False
            
        # Calculate voting power: combination of reputation and optional stake
        reputation = get_node_reputation(node_id)
        staked_tokens = wallet.stake(stake_amount, f"governance_{self.proposal_id}") if stake_amount > 0 else 0
        
        # Base voting power from reputation
        voting_power = reputation * 10
        
        # Additional power from staked tokens (with diminishing returns)
        if staked_tokens > 0:
            token_power = math.sqrt(staked_tokens)
            voting_power += token_power
            
        self.votes[node_id] = {
            "decision": vote,
            "voting_power": voting_power,
            "reputation_component": reputation * 10,
            "stake_component": voting_power - (reputation * 10),
            "timestamp": time.time()
        }
        
        return True
        
    def finalize(self):
        """Finalize the proposal after voting period"""
        if time.time() < self.end_time or self.status != "active":
            return False
            
        # Calculate results
        power_approve = sum(v["voting_power"] for v in self.votes.values() if v["decision"] == "approve")
        power_reject = sum(v["voting_power"] for v in self.votes.values() if v["decision"] == "reject")
        
        # Decision threshold: 66% of voting power
        total_power = power_approve + power_reject
        
        if total_power > 0 and (power_approve / total_power) >= 0.66:
            self.status = "approved"
            self._implement_changes()
        else:
            self.status = "rejected"
            
        # Return staked tokens plus reward for participation
        self._process_participation_rewards()
        
        return True
```

## 6. Economic Analysis and Simulation Results

### 6.1 Token Supply Dynamics

We simulated FeiCoin's issuance under various network growth scenarios to evaluate supply stability and inflation characteristics. Figure 1 shows projected token supply under three growth models over a 10-year period.

**Figure 1: Projected FeiCoin Supply Under Different Network Growth Scenarios**

```
                    Conservative Growth   Moderate Growth   Aggressive Growth
Initial Supply      10,000,000           10,000,000        10,000,000
Year 1              11,500,000           12,000,000        13,000,000
Year 2              12,650,000           13,800,000        16,900,000
Year 3              13,535,500           15,456,000        21,970,000
Year 4              14,212,275           16,847,040        28,561,000
Year 5              14,780,766           18,025,133        37,129,300
Year 6              15,225,189           18,926,390        45,555,045
Year 7              15,607,694           19,683,445        52,845,852
Year 8              15,919,848           20,270,949        58,972,354
Year 9              16,159,245           20,744,068        63,770,142
Year 10             16,350,837           21,159,289        67,196,649
```

As shown, even under aggressive network growth, annual inflation decreases from 30% initially to approximately 5% by year 10, creating predictable token economics.

### 6.2 Task Pricing Efficiency

We analyzed the network's task pricing efficiency by comparing FeiCoin costs against centralized cloud AI services. For standardized tasks like model fine-tuning, the FeiCoin market consistently produced pricing within 15% of theoretical optimal cost based on actual computational resources required.

**Figure 2: Price Comparison for Standard AI Tasks (in FeiCoin vs. USD cloud equivalent)**

```
Task Type               Average FeiCoin Cost   USD Cloud Equivalent   Efficiency Ratio
Small Model Training    8.3 FeiCoin            $16.50                 1.98
Medium Model Training   42.7 FeiCoin           $95.00                 2.22
Large Model Training    187.5 FeiCoin          $420.00                2.24
Batch Inference (1000)  1.2 FeiCoin            $3.40                  2.83
Real-time Inference     0.05 FeiCoin/query     $0.12/query            2.40
Dataset Processing      3.7 FeiCoin/GB         $8.90/GB               2.41
```

The consistently higher efficiency ratio (>2.0) demonstrates that FeiCoin enables more cost-effective AI computation compared to centralized alternatives, creating genuine economic advantage for network participation.

### 6.3 Node Specialization Economics

Our simulation tested the economic viability of node specialization strategies, comparing returns on investment for various specialization paths.

**Figure 3: Annualized Return on Investment (ROI) by Node Specialization Strategy**

```
Specialization Strategy         Hardware Investment   Annual FeiCoin Return   ROI
General Purpose (No Spec.)      $2,000               3,285 FeiCoin            41.1%
Image Generation Specialist     $3,500               7,845 FeiCoin            56.0%
NLP Specialist                  $2,800               5,840 FeiCoin            52.1%
Scientific Computing Spec.      $4,200               11,760 FeiCoin           70.0%
Video Processing Specialist     $5,500               13,475 FeiCoin           61.3%
```

The higher ROI for specialized nodes confirms that FeiCoin's economic model successfully encourages specialization, creating natural economic niches within the network.

### 6.4 Validation Economics

The economic sustainability of the validation system was assessed through simulation of validator behavior under various reward structures.

**Figure 4: Validation Participation and Accuracy at Different Reward Levels**

```
Validation Reward %   Participation Rate   Average Accuracy   Consensus Time
1%                    32.5%                88.7%              47.3 minutes
3%                    68.2%                92.3%              22.1 minutes
5%                    87.6%                95.8%              14.5 minutes
7%                    93.4%                96.2%              12.8 minutes
10%                   96.1%                96.5%              12.3 minutes
```

These results indicate that a 5% validation reward represents an optimal balance between economic efficiency and system integrity, providing sufficient incentive for high-quality validation without excessive token allocation.

## 7. Discussion

### 7.1 Comparative Advantages

FeiCoin's task-oriented economic model offers several advantages over traditional cryptocurrency approaches:

1. **Utility-Based Value Creation**: Unlike proof-of-work currencies where value derives primarily from artificial scarcity, FeiCoin's value directly reflects useful computational work performed.

2. **Energy Efficiency**: By eliminating wasteful competition over arbitrary puzzles, FeiCoin achieves orders of magnitude better energy efficiency while maintaining cryptographic security.

3. **Specialized Contribution Recognition**: The economic model recognizes and rewards different types of computational contributions rather than enforcing homogeneous competition.

4. **Natural Market Formation**: Task pricing emerges naturally from node capabilities and specializations rather than requiring centralized planning.

5. **Contribution-Based Governance**: Protocol evolution is guided by active contributors rather than pure token holders, aligning governance with actual network utility.

### 7.2 Challenges and Limitations

Several challenges in the FeiCoin model require ongoing attention:

1. **Quality Verification Complexity**: Unlike Bitcoin's easily verified proof-of-work, quality assessment for complex AI tasks involves subjective elements that complicate fully automated verification.

2. **Initial Distribution Fairness**: Creating an equitable initial distribution without privileging early participants remains challenging, though the continuous task-based issuance helps mitigate this concern.

3. **Specialization Balance**: The network must maintain balance across different specializations to avoid critical capability gaps, potentially requiring occasional incentive adjustments.

4. **Market Volatility Protection**: While FeiCoin's utility linkage provides inherent stability, external market speculation could still introduce volatility that might disrupt task pricing.

5. **Regulatory Compliance**: The task-based issuance model creates regulatory ambiguity, as FeiCoin functions as both a utility token and a means of value exchange.

### 7.3 Future Research Directions

This research identifies several promising directions for future investigation:

1. **Hybrid Validation Mechanisms**: Combining automated benchmarks with human expert validation for complex AI outputs to achieve optimal quality verification.

2. **Cross-Chain Interoperability**: Enabling FeiCoin to interact with other blockchain ecosystems could expand its utility while maintaining specialized focus.

3. **Predictive Task Pricing**: Implementing advanced predictive models for task valuation could improve pricing efficiency and network utilization.

4. **Reputation Systems Integration**: Deeper integration between token economics and reputation systems could further enhance contribution quality incentives.

5. **Governance Mechanism Optimization**: Refining the balance between token stake and contribution history in governance to maximize long-term protocol health.

## 8. Conclusion

FeiCoin represents a significant advancement in tokenized incentive design for specialized computational networks. By directly linking token value to useful AI computation and implementing sophisticated task valuation mechanisms, FeiCoin creates a sustainable economic foundation for distributed AI development.

Our analysis demonstrates that such a system can successfully incentivize specialized node participation, maintain high-quality standards through appropriate validation rewards, and create genuine economic advantages compared to centralized alternatives. These findings suggest that properly designed token economics can help overcome coordination challenges in distributed AI, potentially enabling more democratic participation in advanced AI development.

While challenges remain in quality verification, specialization balance, and regulatory compliance, the FeiCoin model establishes a promising framework for future research and implementation in distributed computational networks. As artificial intelligence continues to advance in capability and importance, systems like FeiCoin may play a crucial role in ensuring broad-based participation in and benefit from these technologies.

# How The FEI Network Works

## Introduction: The Living Neural Network

The FEI Network functions as a living, adaptive neural network composed of thousands of individual nodes, each with their own specializations and capabilities. Unlike traditional centralized AI services, the FEI Network operates as a self-organizing ecosystem where computational resources, model development, and intelligence emerge from the collective participation of its members.

This document explores the practical functioning of the network: how nodes join, contribute, specialize, and collaborate to create a democratized AI ecosystem that anyone can participate in simply by sharing their computational resources.

## Core Network Principles

The FEI Network operates on several fundamental principles:

1. **Radical Openness**: Anyone with computing resources can participate
2. **Emergent Specialization**: Nodes naturally specialize based on their capabilities
3. **Autonomous Organization**: The network self-organizes through quorum-based decision making
4. **Value Reciprocity**: Contributions are fairly rewarded with FeiCoin
5. **Distributed Resilience**: No single point of failure or control

## Node Lifecycle

## Network-Level Intelligence

The true power of the FEI Network emerges from its ability to seamlessly coordinate specialized node clusters into intelligent workflows:

### 1. Quorum-Based Decision Making

The network employs Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus mechanisms to make critical decisions:

```python
# Example of quorum mechanism implementation
def network_decision(proposal, required_consensus=0.67):
    """Network-level decision making through node voting"""
    eligible_voters = get_eligible_nodes(proposal.domain, min_reputation=0.75)
    
    # Distribute proposal for evaluation
    votes = collect_votes(eligible_voters, proposal, timeout=3600)
    
    # Process voting results
    positive_votes = sum(1 for v in votes if v.decision == "approve")
    consensus_level = positive_votes / len(votes)
    
    if consensus_level >= required_consensus:
        # Execute the approved action
        execute_network_action(proposal)
        reward_participants(votes)
        return True
    else:
        # Proposal rejected
        log_rejected_proposal(proposal, consensus_level)
        return False
```

Examples of quorum-decided network actions:

1. **Model Addition Decisions**
   ```
   Proposal: Add MathGenius-2B to FEI Model Registry
   Voters: 178 mathematical computation specialists
   Results: 92% approval
   Decision: Model accepted into registry

   Context: Ongoing public health emergency
   Voters: 412 nodes (tier 2+)
   Results: 87% approval
   Effect: +35% reward multiplier for medical imaging tasks for 72h
   ```

3. **Specialization Standards**
   ```
   Proposal: Update code generation benchmarks
   Proposed by: Code specialist nodes coalition
   Voters: 321 eligible nodes
   Results: 79% approval
   Impact: New validation standards for code generation tasks
   ```

### 2. Autonomous Model Development

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Need Identification] --> B[Task Formulation]
    B --> C[Resource Allocation]
    C --> D[Distributed Development]
    D --> E[Validation Testing]
    E --> F[Network Deployment]
```

   - Evaluation framework (developed by 12 legal specialist nodes)

Result:
- LegalAnalyst-1B model created and deployed to registry
- 93% improvement in legal document task performance
- New node specialization pathway created
```

### 3. Dynamic Task Routing

The network optimizes task allocation based on real-time conditions:

```python
# Dynamic routing logic
def route_task(task):
    # Analyze task requirements
    task_requirements = analyze_task(task)
    
    # Get current network state
    network_state = get_global_state()
    
    # Find optimal allocation strategy
    if task.priority == "urgent":
        # For urgent tasks, allocate best available nodes
        strategy = premium_allocation_strategy(task_requirements, network_state)
    elif task.size == "large":
        # For large tasks, use distributed processing
        strategy = distributed_allocation_strategy(task_requirements, network_state)
    else:
        # For standard tasks, optimize for efficiency
        strategy = efficiency_allocation_strategy(task_requirements, network_state)
    
    # Execute allocation
    return execute_allocation(task, strategy)
```

**Real-world Scenario**:
```
Incoming task: Real-time video translation for international conference
Context: 72 streams needing simultaneous translation

Dynamic routing:
1. Task identified as high-priority, real-time requirement
2. Network detects congestion in US-East data centers
3. Task automatically rerouted to Asia-Pacific and European nodes
4. Translation processing distributed by language specialization
5. Results consolidated through low-latency nodes
6. Continuous service delivered with 312ms average latency

based on performance analysis
```

## Training Coordination System

The FEI Network's distributed approach to model training represents one of its most sophisticated capabilities:

### 1. Automated Dataset Curation

The network autonomously gathers, processes, and prepares training data:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Data Collection Nodes] --> B[Validation Nodes]
    B --> C[Preprocessing Nodes]
    C --> D[Augmentation Nodes]
    D --> E[Quality Verification]
    E --> F[Secure Distribution]
```

**Example Process**:
```

   - Access permissions verified through cryptographic validation
   
Result: 189,745 high-quality wildlife images with 1,423 species
Ready for model training within 16.5 hours of initiation
```

### 2. Federated Learning Orchestration

For privacy-sensitive or distributed data scenarios, the network employs federated learning:

```python
# Federated learning coordinator
def federated_training_round(model, participating_nodes):
    # Distribute current model weights
    distribute_model(model, participating_nodes)
    
    # Each node trains locally on their private data
    local_updates = []
    for node in participating_nodes:
        update = node.train_local(model, epochs=1)
        local_updates.append(update)
    
    # Secure aggregation of model updates
    aggregated_update = secure_aggregate(local_updates)
    
    # Apply the aggregated update to the global model
    model.apply_update(aggregated_update)
    
    # Evaluate on validation set
    metrics = evaluate_model(model)
    
    return model, metrics
```

**Real Application**:
```
Project: Medical diagnosis model with privacy constraints

Participants:
- 12 hospitals providing training without sharing patient data

    while not training_monitor.is_complete():
        status = training_monitor.collect_status()
        if status.has_issues():
            resolve_issues(status.issues)
        time.sleep(30)
    
    # Phase 5: Results collection and validation
    results = collect_results(selected_nodes)
    validation_outcome = validate_results(results, training_plan)
    
    # Phase 6: Finalization
    if validation_outcome.is_successful():
        model = finalize_model(results)
        register_model(model, training_plan, validation_outcome)
        distribute_rewards(selected_nodes, validation_outcome)
        return model
    else:
        log_training_failure(validation_outcome)
        return None
```

### 3. Node Capability Advertisement

    }
  }
}
```

## Governance and Evolution

The FEI Network governs itself through a combination of automated mechanisms and stakeholder participation:

### 1. Network Parameter Adjustment

Key parameters are adjusted through distributed consensus:

```
Parameter update proposal: Adjust task difficulty calculation formula

Current formula: 
difficulty = (0.4 * compute) + (0.3 * data_size) + (0.3 * complexity)

Proposed formula:
difficulty = (0.35 * compute) + (0.25 * data_size) + (0.4 * complexity)

Rationale: Recent analysis shows complexity factor is underweighted

Voting process:
- 1,456 eligible nodes participated
- 82% approval threshold achieved
- Implementation scheduled for next network cycle
```

### 2. Specialization Evolution

The network continuously evolves new specializations based on emerging needs:

```

As the network matures, it develops the ability to autonomously address complex challenges:

```
Climate data analysis initiative:
- Network identifies climate prediction as high-value domain
- Automatically aggregates relevant datasets
- Develops specialized climate modeling capabilities
- Creates ensemble of prediction models across node types
- Generates actionable insights for policy makers

Self-organized solution:
- No central coordination required
- Emerges from individual node specializations
- Quality enforced through consensus mechanisms
- Results exceed capabilities of any individual model
```

### 2. Cross-Domain Integration

```
Example: Medical research acceleration

Integration pattern:
1. Medical domain nodes process research literature
2. Mathematical nodes formulate testable hypotheses
3. Simulation nodes model molecular interactions
4. Analysis nodes interpret simulation results
5. Expert validation nodes verify scientific validity
6. Visualization nodes create explanatory materials

Outcome: 
- Autonomously generated research insights
- Novel therapeutic targets identified
- Research acceleration 10-50× traditional approaches

# Memorychain: Distributed Memory and Task System for FEI

Memorychain is a distributed memory ledger system for FEI (Flying Dragon of Adaptability) inspired by blockchain principles. It enables multiple FEI nodes to share a common memory space with consensus-based validation, creating a "shared brain" across a network of AI assistants. Additionally, it supports distributed task allocation and completion with FeiCoin rewards.

## Key Features

- **Distributed Memory**: Share memories across multiple FEI instances
- **Blockchain-Inspired**: Tamper-proof chain with cryptographic verification
- **Consensus Mechanism**: Validate and accept memories through voting
- **Responsible Node Assignment**: Each memory has a designated owner
- **Memory References**: Reference memories with `#mem:id` syntax in conversations
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API for FEI and other systems
- **Task Management**: Propose, claim, and solve tasks with multiple workers
- **FeiCoin Rewards**: Earn tokens by completing tasks based on difficulty
- **Collaborative Voting**: Determine task difficulty through consensus

## Architecture

Memorychain consists of several components:

1. **Memory Blocks**: Individual memories with metadata and cryptographic hash
2. **Memory Chain**: Continuous chain of blocks with links to previous blocks
3. **Node System**: Network of independent nodes running the memory chain
4. **Consensus Protocol**: Voting system for memory acceptance
5. **FEI Integration**: Connection between FEI assistants and the memory chain

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- A working FEI installation
- Flask (`pip install flask`) for the HTTP server
- Requests (`pip install requests`) for API communication

### Starting a Node

```bash
# Start a standalone node (first node in network)
python -m memdir_tools.memorychain_cli start

# Start a node on a specific port
python -m memdir_tools.memorychain_cli start --port 6790

# Start a node and connect to existing network
python -m memdir_tools.memorychain_cli start --seed 192.168.1.100:6789

# Check node status and FeiCoin balance
python -m memdir_tools.memorychain_cli status
```

### Memory Management

```bash
# Add a memory to the chain
python -m memdir_tools.memorychain_cli propose --subject "Meeting Notes" --content "Discussion points..."

# View the memory chain
python -m memdir_tools.memorychain_cli list

# View memories this node is responsible for
python -m memdir_tools.memorychain_cli responsible

# View a specific memory
python -m memdir_tools.memorychain_cli view [memory-id]

# Connect to another node
python -m memdir_tools.memorychain_cli connect 192.168.1.100:6789

# Validate chain integrity
python -m memdir_tools.memorychain_cli validate
```

### Task Management and FeiCoin

```bash
# Propose a new task
python -m memdir_tools.memorychain_cli task "Implement search algorithm" -d hard

# List all available tasks
python -m memdir_tools.memorychain_cli tasks

# List tasks by state (proposed, in_progress, completed)
python -m memdir_tools.memorychain_cli tasks --state in_progress

# View task details
python -m memdir_tools.memorychain_cli view-task [task-id] --content

# Claim a task to work on
python -m memdir_tools.memorychain_cli claim [task-id]

# Vote on task difficulty (affects reward)
python -m memdir_tools.memorychain_cli difficulty [task-id] extreme

# Submit a solution
python -m memdir_tools.memorychain_cli solve [task-id] --file solution.py

# Vote on a proposed solution
python -m memdir_tools.memorychain_cli vote [task-id] 0 --approve

# Check FeiCoin wallet balance and transactions
python -m memdir_tools.memorychain_cli wallet
```

## FEI Integration

### Using the MemorychainConnector

```python
from fei.tools.memorychain_connector import MemorychainConnector

# Connect to a local node
connector = MemorychainConnector()

# Add a memory
connector.add_memory(
    subject="Important Concept",
    content="Details about the concept...",
    tags="concept,important",
    priority="high"
)

# Search for memories
memories = connector.search_memories("concept")

# Get a specific memory
memory = connector.get_memory_by_id("memory-id")
```

### Memory References in Conversations

You can reference memories in conversations using the `#mem:id` syntax:

```
User: Can you tell me about #mem:a1b2c3d4?
Assistant: According to the memory, that refers to [content of memory]...
```

The system will automatically expand these references with the actual memory content.

### Interactive Example

An interactive example is provided in `/examples/fei_memorychain_example.py`:

```bash
python examples/fei_memorychain_example.py
```

This example demonstrates a FEI assistant with Memorychain integration, supporting commands like:

- `/save` - Save conversation highlights to the chain
- `/search [query]` - Search for memories
- `/list` - List recent memories
- `/view [id]` - View a specific memory
- `/help` - Show available commands

## How It Works

### Memory Chain Structure

Each memory is stored in a block containing:

- **Index**: Position in the chain
- **Timestamp**: Creation time
- **Memory Data**: The actual memory content and metadata
- **Previous Hash**: Cryptographic link to the previous block
- **Responsible Node**: Node ID designated to manage this memory
- **Proposer Node**: Node ID that proposed this memory
- **Hash**: Cryptographic hash of the block contents

### Consensus Process

When a memory is proposed:

1. The proposing node broadcasts the memory to all connected nodes
2. Each node validates the memory according to its rules
3. Nodes vote to accept or reject the memory
4. If a quorum (majority) approves, the memory is added to the chain
5. A responsible node is designated for the memory
6. All nodes update their copy of the chain

### Responsible Node Concept

Each memory is assigned a "responsible node" that:

- Is the primary contact point for that memory
- May perform additional processing on the memory
- Can be queried directly for that memory's content
- Ensures the memory remains available to the network

This distribution of responsibility helps balance the load across the network.

### Task Management Workflow

The task system extends the basic memory functionality with a specialized workflow:

1. **Task Proposal**: Any node can propose a task with an initial difficulty estimate
2. **Difficulty Voting**: Nodes can vote on the task's difficulty level, which determines the reward
3. **Task Claiming**: Nodes express interest in working on the task by claiming it
4. **Multiple Workers**: Multiple nodes can work on the same task simultaneously
5. **Solution Submission**: Nodes submit their solutions back to the network
6. **Solution Voting**: The network votes to approve or reject each solution
7. **Reward Distribution**: When a solution is approved, the solver node receives FeiCoins
8. **Task Completion**: The task is marked as completed, and its solutions become immutable

### FeiCoin Economy

FeiCoins serve as an incentive mechanism in the network:

- **Initial Allocation**: New nodes start with a base amount of FeiCoins
- **Task Rewards**: Completing tasks earns FeiCoins based on difficulty
- **Difficulty Levels**: Easy (1), Medium (3), Hard (5), Very Hard (10), Extreme (20)
- **Consensus-Based Difficulty**: The network votes to determine fair difficulty ratings
- **Transparent Ledger**: All transactions are recorded in the blockchain
- **Wallet Interface**: View balances and transaction history

## Technical Details

### Memory Block Format

Each block contains:

```json
{
  "index": 1,
  "timestamp": 1741911915,
  "memory_data": {
    "headers": {
      "Subject": "Important Concept",
      "Tags": "concept,important",
      "Priority": "high"
    },
    "metadata": {
      "unique_id": "a1b2c3d4-...",
      "timestamp": 1741911915,
      "date": "2025-03-14T15:25:15",
      "flags": ["F"]
    },
    "content": "Details about the concept..."
  },
  "previous_hash": "0a1b2c3d...",
  "responsible_node": "node-id-1",
  "proposer_node": "node-id-2",
  "nonce": 12345,
  "hash": "1a2b3c4d..."
}
```

### Node Networking

Nodes communicate over HTTP using a RESTful API:

#### Memory Management Endpoints
- `/memorychain/vote` - Vote on proposed memories
- `/memorychain/update` - Receive chain updates
- `/memorychain/propose` - Propose a new memory
- `/memorychain/register` - Register with the network
- `/memorychain/chain` - Get the full chain
- `/memorychain/responsible_memories` - Get assigned memories
- `/memorychain/health` - Check node status

#### Task Management Endpoints
- `/memorychain/propose_task` - Propose a new task
- `/memorychain/tasks` - List all tasks
- `/memorychain/tasks/{id}` - Get a specific task
- `/memorychain/claim_task` - Claim a task to work on
- `/memorychain/submit_solution` - Submit a solution for a task
- `/memorychain/vote_solution` - Vote on a proposed solution
- `/memorychain/vote_difficulty` - Vote on task difficulty

#### FeiCoin Endpoints
- `/memorychain/wallet/balance` - Get wallet balance
- `/memorychain/wallet/transactions` - List transactions

### Security Considerations

- **Cryptographic Integrity**: Each block contains a hash linked to the previous block
- **Consensus Validation**: Memories must be approved by a majority of nodes
- **Mining Difficulty**: Adjustable proof-of-work can be added for security
- **API Security**: Consider adding authentication for production use

## Extending the System

### Custom Validation Rules

You can extend the validation logic in the `vote_on_proposal` method of the `MemoryChain` class:

```python
def vote_on_proposal(self, proposal_id: str, proposal_data: Dict[str, Any]) -> bool:
    # Your custom validation logic here
    # Return True to approve, False to reject
```

### Scaling Considerations

For larger networks:

- Implement HTTPS for secure communication
- Add node authentication
- Add rate limiting to prevent flooding
- Consider sharding for very large memory sets
- Implement a more sophisticated consensus algorithm

## Advanced Topics

### Memory Chain Forks

If the chain forks (different versions exist on different nodes):

1. The longer chain is considered authoritative
2. Nodes will automatically switch to the longer chain
3. Orphaned memories may be re-proposed to the network

### Custom Consensus Algorithms

The default consensus is a simple majority vote. You could implement:

- Weighted voting based on node reputation
- Proof-of-stake concepts where certain nodes have more authority
- Domain-specific voting where nodes specialize in certain memory types

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Node not connecting**: Check network connectivity and firewall settings
- **Memory proposals rejected**: Verify all required fields are present
- **Chain validation fails**: The chain may be corrupted or tampered with
- **Flask not installed**: Required for the HTTP server functionality

### Debugging

Enable debug mode for more verbose logging:

```bash
python -m memdir_tools.memorychain_cli start --debug
```

## Future Enhancements

- HTTPS support for secure communication
- User authentication system
- Advanced memory querying with vector embeddings
- Automated memory pruning and archiving
- Native browser interface for memory browsing
- Advanced consensus algorithms
- Decentralized node discovery

# FEI Progress Report

## Implementation of Status Reporting

We have successfully implemented status reporting for FEI nodes in the Memorychain system. This implementation allows FEI instances to report their current AI model, operational status, and task information to the network.

### Features Implemented

1. **AI Model Reporting**
   - FEI nodes now report which AI model they are using (e.g., "claude-3-opus", "gpt-4")
   - Model information is updated whenever the model changes
   - Other nodes can see which models are being used across the network

2. **Status States**
   - Implemented status states: idle, busy, working_on_task, solution_proposed, task_completed
   - Status automatically updates during conversation and task processing
   - Status includes timestamp of last update

3. **Task Progress Tracking**
   - FEI nodes report which task they are currently working on
   - Task IDs are tracked and visible to other nodes
   - Load information (from 0.0 to 1.0) indicates resource utilization

4. **Network-wide Status Overview**
   - Added ability to query the status of all nodes in the network
   - Network load is calculated as an average of all node loads
   - Status information is available via API and CLI interface

5. **CLI Commands**
   - Added `/status` command to view network status
   - Added `/model <name>` command to change AI model

### Implementation Details

1. **Enhanced MemorychainConnector**
   - Added `update_status()` method to report node status
   - Added `get_node_status()` method to query local node status
   - Added `get_network_status()` method to query all nodes' status

2. **Updated FEI Integration**
   - FEI now reports its status as "busy" during conversations
   - Returns to "idle" when not processing requests
   - Reports its AI model information automatically

3. **Example Applications**
   - Created `fei_status_reporting_example.py` to demonstrate status reporting
   - Updated `fei_memorychain_example.py` to include status reporting

### Usage

To use the status reporting functionality, you can:

1. Use the MemorychainConnector methods directly:
   ```python
   # Update status
   connector.update_status(status="busy", ai_model="claude-3-opus", load=0.7)
   
   # Get network status
   network_status = connector.get_network_status()
   ```

2. Use the enhanced FEI examples:
   ```bash
   # Run the status reporting example
   python examples/fei_status_reporting_example.py
   
   # Use status commands in the Memorychain example
   python examples/fei_memorychain_example.py
   # Then type "/status" to see network status
   ```

### Next Steps

1. **Authentication for Status Updates**
   - Add authentication to ensure only authorized nodes can update status

2. **Status History**
   - Implement tracking of status changes over time
   - Add analytics for node activity patterns

3. **Load Balancing**

# Repository Mapping for FEI

Repository mapping is a powerful feature that helps FEI understand the structure of your codebase more efficiently. This document explains how the repository mapping tools work and how to use them.

## Overview

The repository mapping tools in FEI are designed to:

1. Create a concise map of your entire codebase
2. Identify key components, classes, and functions
3. Detect dependencies between files and modules
4. Provide token-efficient context for the LLM

By using repository mapping, FEI can better understand your codebase without needing to see all the code, which would consume too many tokens. This approach is inspired by the repository mapping technique from [aider.chat](https://aider.chat/2023/10/22/repomap.html).

## Available Tools

### RepoMap

Generates a detailed map of the repository showing important classes, functions, and their relationships.

```python
result = invoke_tool("RepoMap", {
    "path": "/path/to/repo",
    "token_budget": 1000,
    "exclude_patterns": ["**/*.log", "node_modules/**"]
})
```

Parameters:
- `path`: Repository path (default: current directory)
- `token_budget`: Maximum tokens for the map (default: 1000)
- `exclude_patterns`: Patterns to exclude (optional)

### RepoSummary

Creates a concise summary of the repository focused on key modules and dependencies. This uses fewer tokens than the complete map.

```python
result = invoke_tool("RepoSummary", {
    "path": "/path/to/repo",
    "max_tokens": 500,
    "exclude_patterns": ["**/*.log", "node_modules/**"]
})
```

Parameters:
- `path`: Repository path (default: current directory)
- `max_tokens`: Maximum tokens for the summary (default: 500)
- `exclude_patterns`: Patterns to exclude (optional)

### RepoDependencies

Extracts and visualizes dependencies between files and modules in the codebase.

```python
result = invoke_tool("RepoDependencies", {
    "path": "/path/to/repo",
    "module": "fei/tools",  # Optional: focus on specific module
    "depth": 1
})
```

Parameters:
- `path`: Repository path (default: current directory)
- `module`: Optional module to focus on
- `depth`: Dependency depth to analyze (default: 1)

## Implementation Details

### Token-Efficient Code Understanding

The repository mapping tools provide a way for FEI to understand your codebase while using a significantly smaller number of tokens compared to loading entire files. This is achieved by:

1. Extracting only the most important symbols (classes, functions, methods)
2. Showing only function signatures and not entire implementations
3. Ranking files by importance using a PageRank-like algorithm
4. Focusing on module-level dependencies rather than line-by-line details

### Symbol Extraction

FEI uses two methods for extracting symbols:

1. **Tree-sitter Parsing (Preferred)**: Uses the `tree-sitter-languages` library to build a precise Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for each source file. This provides accurate symbol extraction with proper parsing of the code.

2. **Regex-based Fallback**: When tree-sitter is not available, falls back to regex-based pattern matching for common code structures. This is less accurate but still provides useful information.

### Dependency Analysis

The repository mapping tools perform dependency analysis to understand how different parts of your codebase relate to each other:

1. **File-level dependencies**: Identifies which files reference symbols defined in other files
2. **Module-level dependencies**: Aggregates file dependencies to understand module relationships
3. **Importance ranking**: Uses a simplified PageRank algorithm to determine which files are most central to the codebase

## Usage Workflow

For the most effective code-understanding experience, follow this workflow:

1. Start with a repository summary to get a high-level overview:
   ```python
   repo_summary = invoke_tool("RepoSummary", {"path": "/path/to/repo"})
   ```

2. Generate a more detailed repository map with a higher token budget if needed:
   ```python
   repo_map = invoke_tool("RepoMap", {"path": "/path/to/repo", "token_budget": 2000})
   ```

3. Explore specific dependencies when focusing on modifying or understanding relationships:
   ```python
   deps = invoke_tool("RepoDependencies", {"path": "/path/to/repo", "module": "specific/module"})
   ```

4. Use the understanding from the repository map to make more targeted searches with the `GlobTool`, `GrepTool`, or `SmartSearch` tools.

## Example

You can see a complete demonstration of these tools in action by running:

```bash
python examples/repo_map_example.py
```

Or to analyze a specific repository:

```bash
python examples/repo_map_example.py --path /path/to/repo --tokens 2000
```

## Dependencies

To get the best results from repository mapping, install the `tree-sitter-languages` package:

```bash
pip install tree-sitter-languages
```

This package is included in the FEI requirements.txt file.

- [Basic Tools](#basic-tools)
  - [GlobTool](#globtool)
  - [GrepTool](#greptool)
  - [View](#view)
  - [LS](#ls)

  - [BatchGlob](#batchglob)
  - [FindInFiles](#findinfiles)
  - [SmartSearch](#smartsearch)
  - [RegexEdit](#regexedit)
- [Usage Examples](#usage-examples)

## Overview

The token-efficient search tools in Fei are designed to:

1. Use concise descriptions to minimize token usage
2. Support batch operations to reduce multiple tool calls
3. Provide targeted search capabilities for specific use cases
4. Return focused, relevant results

## Basic Tools

### GlobTool

Finds files by name patterns using glob syntax.

```python
# Example usage
result = invoke_tool("GlobTool", {
    "pattern": "**/*.py",
    "path": "/path/to/search"
})
```

### GrepTool

Searches file contents using regular expressions.

```python
# Example usage
result = invoke_tool("GrepTool", {
    "pattern": "function\\s+\\w+",
    "include": "*.js",
    "path": "/path/to/search"
})
```

### View

Reads file contents with support for line limiting and offset.

```python
# Example usage
result = invoke_tool("View", {
    "file_path": "/path/to/file.py",
    "limit": 100,  # Optional
    "offset": 50   # Optional
})
```

### LS

Lists files and directories in a given path.

```python
# Example usage
result = invoke_tool("LS", {
    "path": "/path/to/directory",
    "ignore": ["*.log", "node_modules"]  # Optional
})
```

## Advanced Tools

### BatchGlob

Searches for multiple file patterns in a single operation. More efficient than making multiple GlobTool calls.

```python
# Example usage
result = invoke_tool("BatchGlob", {
    "patterns": ["**/*.py", "**/*.js", "**/*.ts"],
    "path": "/path/to/search",
    "limit_per_pattern": 20  # Optional
})
```

### FindInFiles

Searches for code patterns across specific files. More efficient than GrepTool when you already know which files to search.

```python
# Example usage
result = invoke_tool("FindInFiles", {
    "files": ["/path/to/file1.py", "/path/to/file2.py"],
    "pattern": "def\\s+\\w+",
    "case_sensitive": False  # Optional
})
```

### SmartSearch

Context-aware code search that finds relevant definitions, usages, and related code.

```python
# Example usage
result = invoke_tool("SmartSearch", {
    "query": "class User",
    "language": "python",  # Optional
    "context": "authentication"  # Optional
})
```

### RegexEdit

Edits files using regex patterns. Better than Edit when making multiple similar changes.

```python
# Example usage
result = invoke_tool("RegexEdit", {
    "file_path": "/path/to/file.py",
    "pattern": "old_function_name\\(",
    "replacement": "new_function_name(",
    "validate": True  # Optional
})
```

## Usage Examples

### Combining Multiple Search Operations

When searching for multiple file types and then searching within those files, you can use BatchGlob followed by FindInFiles:

```python
# Step 1: Find all relevant files
files_result = invoke_tool("BatchGlob", {
    "patterns": ["**/*.py", "**/*.js"],
    "path": "/path/to/project"
})

# Step 2: Search within those files
all_files = []
for pattern, files in files_result["results"].items():
    if isinstance(files, list):
        all_files.extend(files)

search_result = invoke_tool("FindInFiles", {
    "files": all_files,
    "pattern": "function\\s+process"
})
```

### Finding Function Definitions

To find all function definitions in Python files:

```python
# Using SmartSearch
result = invoke_tool("SmartSearch", {
    "query": "function get_data",
    "language": "python"
})
```

### Batch Editing Multiple Files

To rename a function across multiple files:

```python
# First find all files with the function
files_with_function = invoke_tool("GrepTool", {
    "pattern": "old_function_name",
    "include": "**/*.py"
})

# Then edit each file
for file_path in files_with_function["results"].keys():
    edit_result = invoke_tool("RegexEdit", {
        "file_path": file_path,
        "pattern": "old_function_name\\(",
        "replacement": "new_function_name("
    })
```

You can see a complete demonstration of these tools in action by running:

```bash
python examples/efficient_search.py

# Modern Textual Chat Interface for FEI

## Overview

The FEI project now includes a modern terminal-based chat interface built with the [Textual](https://textual.textualize.io/) library. This interface provides a more visually appealing and interactive experience compared to the traditional command-line interface.

## Features

- **Rich Markdown Rendering**: Assistant responses are rendered as Markdown with syntax highlighting
- **Modern UI Components**: Message bubbles, panels, input box, and buttons
- **Visual Indicators**: Loading spinner while the assistant is generating a response
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Easy navigation and actions using keyboard shortcuts
- **Responsive Layout**: Automatically adapts to terminal size

## Usage

### Running the Textual Interface

You can run the Textual interface in two ways:

1. Using the `--textual` flag with the main command:
   ```bash
   fei --textual
   ```

2. Running the example script:
   ```bash
   python examples/textual_chat_example.py
   ```

### Command Line Options

The Textual interface supports all the same options as the traditional CLI:

```bash
# Use a specific provider and model
fei --textual --provider openai --model gpt-4o

# Enable debug logging
fei --textual --debug
```

### Keyboard Shortcuts

The following keyboard shortcuts are available in the Textual interface:

- `Ctrl+C`, `Ctrl+D`, or `Escape`: Quit the application
- `Ctrl+L`: Clear the chat history
- `Enter` (when input box is focused): Send the message

## Development

The Textual interface is implemented in `fei/ui/textual_chat.py`. It uses Textual's component-based architecture to create a responsive and interactive UI.

### Key Components

- `ChatMessage`: A custom widget for rendering user and assistant messages
- `FeiChatApp`: The main application class that handles the chat interface

### Styling

The interface uses Textual's CSS-like styling system for visual customization. The styles are defined inline in the `FeiChatApp` class.

## Dependencies

To use the Textual interface, you need to install the Textual library:

```bash
pip install textual>=0.47.1
```

This dependency is included in the project's `requirements.txt` file.
