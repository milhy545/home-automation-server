## 🔍 Overview

Fei is an advanced AI-powered code assistant built to enhance software development workflows. It integrates with multiple LLM providers, offers powerful code manipulation tools, and features a distributed memory system for persistent knowledge across sessions.

By leveraging the capabilities of large language models like Claude and GPT, Fei provides intelligent assistance for coding tasks, code search, refactoring, and documentation.

## 🌈 Project Vision

The Fei project represents more than just a code assistant; it's part of a broader vision for a democratized AI ecosystem called the FEI Network (Flying Dragon of Adaptability Network).

The FEI Network aims to be a truly democratic, distributed system of artificial intelligence that serves the collective good through:

1. **Distributed Processing**: Harnessing collective computational power across millions of individual nodes
2. **Specialized Intelligence Federation**: Creating a network of specialized intelligences that collaborate through open protocols
3. **Task-Oriented Contribution**: Participants contribute according to their capability, transforming computation from wasteful competition to purposeful collaboration
4. **Global Inclusion**: Active design for participation across economic, geographic, linguistic, and cultural boundaries
5. **Public Benefit Orientation**: Serving humanity's collective interests rather than narrow priorities

The project stands as an alternative to centralized AI approaches, focusing on human agency, democratization of artificial intelligence, and equitable distribution of computational power.

### Memory System Usage

```bash
# Create memory directory structure
python -m memdir_tools

# Create a new memory
python -m memdir_tools create --subject "Meeting Notes" --tags "notes,meeting" --content "Discussion points..."

# List memories in folder
python -m memdir_tools list --folder ".Projects/Python"

# Search memories
python -m memdir_tools search "python"

# Advanced search with complex query
python -m memdir_tools search "tags:python,important date>now-7d Status=active sort:date" --format compact
```

## 🌐 FEI Network

Fei is part of the broader FEI Network vision - a distributed, democratic system for collective intelligence. The network functions as a living, adaptive neural network composed of thousands of individual nodes, each with specialized capabilities.

### Core Network Principles

1. **Radical Openness**: Anyone with computing resources can participate
2. **Emergent Specialization**: Nodes naturally specialize based on their capabilities
3. **Autonomous Organization**: The network self-organizes through quorum-based decision making
4. **Value Reciprocity**: Contributions are fairly rewarded with FeiCoin
5. **Distributed Resilience**: No single point of failure or control

### Node Specializations

The FEI Network consists of specialized node types:

- **Mathematical Nodes**: Solving complex computational problems and formal reasoning
- **Creative Nodes**: Generation of text, images, music, and creative works
- **Analytical Nodes**: Pattern recognition, data analysis, and insight extraction
- **Knowledge Nodes**: Information retrieval, verification, and contextualization
- **Coordination Nodes**: Supporting collaboration between humans and AI systems

### Technical Implementation

The network is implemented through several layers:

- **Computation Layer**: Harnessing diverse hardware
- **Memory Layer**: Distributed storage of models and knowledge
- **Communication Layer**: Efficient routing of tasks and results
- **Verification Layer**: Ensuring quality and alignment with human values
- **Governance Layer**: Enabling collective decision-making

## 🏗️ Architecture
